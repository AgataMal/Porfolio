## About me
---
My name is Agata Malczyk. During my maternity leave I decided to change my career and decided to become a software tester.
In the beginning, I concentrated my effort on manual testing, completing various courses and obtaining the ISTQB certificate. I really liked manual testing, but in the meantime I also started to be interested in test automation. Therefore, I decided to expand my existing knowledge and go in this direction. Thanks to my experience in sales, I have highly developed communication and organizational skills that help me function well in a team. In this portfolio, I would like to share my knowledge in the field of testing and present my technical skills that I have gained during my studies so far. I am determined to continue to develop in this field.
